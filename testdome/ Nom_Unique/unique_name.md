A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward or forward. Write a function that checks if a given word is a palindrome. Character case should be ignored For example, is palindrome("Deleveled") should return true as character case should be ignored, resulting in "deleveled", which is a palindrome since it reads the same backward and forward.
